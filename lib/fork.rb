# An object representing a fork, containing data about it like pid, exit_status,
# exception etc.
#
# It also provides facilities for parent and child process to communicate
# with each other.
#
# @example Usage
#     def fib(n) n < 2 ? n : fib(n-1)+fib(n-2); end # <-- bad implementation of fibonacci
#     fork = Fork.new :return do
#       fib(35)
#     end
#     fork.execute
#     puts "Forked child process with pid #{fork.pid} is currently #{fork.alive? ? 'alive' : 'dead'}"
#     puts fork.return_value # this blocks, until the fork finished, and returns the last value
#
# @example The same, but a bit simpler
#     def fib(n) n < 2 ? n : fib(n-1)+fib(n-2); end # <-- bad implementation of fibonacci
#     fork = Fork.execute :return do
#       fib(35)
#     end
#     puts fork.return_value # this blocks, until the fork finished, and returns the last value
#
# @example And the simplest version, if all you care about is the return value
#     def fib(n) n < 2 ? n : fib(n-1)+fib(n-2); end # <-- bad implementation of fibonacci
#     future = Fork.future do
#       fib(35)

  # Create a new Fork instance.
  # @param [Symbol, Hash] flags
  #   Tells the fork what facilities to provide. You can pass the flags either as a list
  #   of symbols, or as a Hash, or even mixed (the hash must be the last argument then).
  #
  #   Valid flags are:
  #   * :return       Make the value of the last expression (return value) available to
  #                   the parent process
  #   * :exceptions   Pass exceptions of the fork to the parent, making it available via
  #                   Fork#exception
  #   * :death_notice Send the parent process an information when done processing
  #   * :to_fork      You can write to the Fork from the parent process, and read in the
  #                   child process
  #   * :from_fork    You can read from the Fork in the parent process and write in the
  #                   child process
  #   * :ctrl         Provides an additional IO for control mechanisms
  #
  #   Some flags implicitly set other flags. For example, :return will set :exceptions and
  #   :ctrl, :exceptions will set :ctrl and :death_notice will also set :ctrl.
  #
  # The subprocess is not immediatly executed, you must invoke #execute on the Fork
  # instance in order to get it executed. Only then #pid, #in, #out and #ctrl will be
  # available. Also all IO related methods won't work before that.
